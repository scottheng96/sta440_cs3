```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Below are output for models with:
- All coefficients/intercepts having N(0,0.1) priors
- All coefficients/intercepts having M(0,0.001) priors

```{r}
var1 <- readRDS("whovotes_model_01var.rda.rds")
var001<- readRDS("whovotes_model_strongest.rda.rds")
```

```{r}
library(brms)
summary(var1)
```

```{r}
summary(var001)
```

Below is code to do posterior distributions of fitted coefficients and MCMC mixing:

```{r}
plot(var1)
```


Takes forever but this is a comparison of the models based on LOOCV estimates:

```{r}
brms::LOO(var1, var001)
```

This is supposed to be a posterior predictive check, but it's pretty hard to read due to dist of data:

```{r}
brms::pp_check(real_model)
```
